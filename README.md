An RStudio addin to provide easy and interactive time series
visualization. To be visible to the addin, time series must be stored in
a dataframe in the global environment, with:

  - at least a column of type *Date*
  - at least a column of type *numeric*

## Installation

You can install the released version of tsviz from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("tsviz")
```

Or install the development version from Github:

``` r
devtools::install_github("donlelef/tsviz")
```

Once you have installed the package, you do not need to load it with
`library()`, the addins are installed on your machine as part of the
package install process.

## Example

First, let us load some suitable data:

``` r
library(tsviz)
prices <- crypto_prices
```

Then, we can run the addin:

Thatâ€™s it.
